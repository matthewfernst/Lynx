## About Project

This project is the source code for the companion app for [Mountain-UI](https://github.com/matthewfernst/Mountain-UI)! You can download this app in the [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) to quickly upload your skiing/snowboarding data and
have your stats displayed on the Mountain-UI display. Add friends and be able to compete on leader boards and see who is on top all at a glance at your iPhone or your Mounatin-UI display.
